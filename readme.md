# Application Tutorial Video
![Tutorial](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43766100/146308100-303cd5de-2aa3-436c-af36-881da41d8dec.mp4)

If tutorial doesn't work, it is in the readme_images folder and it is call calc-vid-tut.mp4.

# Note
+ If it doesn't work at first on Docker, you may have to `pip install -r requirements` inside of a terminal inside of flask on Pycharm, delete all past images, build it again, and then it should work.
